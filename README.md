## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### Introduction
I'm **Pizza**, a big fan of the ***Touhou Project*** since 2022, and I do a lot of things related to it. I do it as a hobby and with no intention of making money or becoming famous from it.

### Focus
I just want to share the things I think and do about Touhou, and show that it's not just a bullet hell game, but something deeper, such as its lore, the feelings it gives us, music, artworks and also the impact it has on Internet culture.  
I also want to make some more deep stuff accessible to the Portuguese-speaking public, such like the stories of music CDs, which is what I do most here.

### Afterword
If you want to share my translations or things I do, or somehow improve them, I allow it, as long as it's respectful and without insulting or judging. I'm not so bothered by it, but I'd be happy if you give the credits too, whether for me, for the translation and, above all, for Team Shanghai Alice, for the original work.  
I don't think people deserve to be judged or ridiculed for what they are or do, unless it's something really wrong.  
Anyone of any ethnicity, sexuality or disability is welcome here. And if you don't respect people's differences or have any kind of discrimination against them, I ask you to immediately take yourself out of my profile.  

That's all, I hope you've understood. =)
