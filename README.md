## Hello‚≠ê

I'm **Pizza**, a big fan of the ***Touhou Project*** and ZUN's works since 2022, and I do a lot of things related to it. I do it as a hobby and with no intention of making money or popularizing it.  
  
My purpose is to share interesting facts about Touhou, and show that it's not just a simple bullet hell game, but something deeper, such as its lore, the feelings it gives us, music, artworks and also the impact it has on Internet culture.  
I also want to make some more deep stuff accessible to the Portuguese-speaking public, such like the stories of the official CDs, which is what I do most here.

If you want to share my translations or things I do, or somehow improve them, I allow it, as long as it's respectful and without insulting or judging. I'm not so bothered by it, but I'd be happy if you give the credits too, whether for me, for the translation and, above all, for Team Shanghai Alice, for the original work.  

That's all, I hope you've understood.
